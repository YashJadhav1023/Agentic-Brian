## Layout

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `agents/base/adapter.py` | `AgentAdapter` contract, `Capability`, `AgentStatus`, `TaskExecutionResult`, `UNKNOWN_MODEL` |
| `agents/antigravity/` | Provider factory + per-account adapter; `account1/`, `account2/` are named config handles |
| `agents/kiro/`, `agents/cline/` | Single-account CLI adapters |
| `config/providers.json` | The only configuration source |
| `providers/registry/` | Config loader, `Provider`, `ProviderRegistry`, bootstrap |
| `models/policies/model_policy.py` | Verified catalogues, deterministic selection, honest verification |
| `brain/router/` | Capability-aware scored routing |
| `brain/orchestrator/` | Orchestrator + bounded swarm pool |
| `brain/context/continuator.py` | Universal Continue |
| `tasks/` | Persistent task lifecycle |
| `sessions/` | task -> session -> conversation mapping |
| `memory/` | Shared SQLite store + relevance retrieval |
| `handoffs/` | Markdown + JSON handoff records and archive |
| `events/` | Append-only JSONL event bus |
| `locks/` | Atomic file locks with TTL |
| `ui/dashboard/` | Mission Control (loopback only) |
| `tests/` | 87 unit and integration tests |

## Design rules

1. **Provider-agnostic core.** Nothing above the adapter layer knows what a CLI
   flag is. Adding a provider touches config plus one adapter.
2. **One command builder per provider.** `--app_data_dir` appears in exactly one
   function, which is what makes account isolation structural rather than
   conventional.
3. **Never fabricate.** If a provider does not report the model, the model is
   `unknown`. If a run produces no output, it failed.
4. **Least privilege by default.** Permission escalation is opt-in, per task or
   per account, and is visible in the task record and the UI.
5. **Bounded resources.** `MAX_CONCURRENT_AGENTS=2` for this 2-core / 16 GB
   host, from config, overridable by environment.
6. **Durable state, no daemons.** Plain JSON/JSONL/SQLite files on disk, so the
   system survives a crash and can be inspected without running anything.
